Crowd-sourced Movie Reviews
_____________________________

I wanted a simple platform where folks can rate,comment on and post
movie/series/ tv show reviews in the spirit of a social web.

There are some great review sites like:

1. Rotten Tomatoes    <http://www.rottentomatoes.com/>
2. Roger Ebert        <http://www.rogerebert.com/>
3. Et al.             <http://www.raindance.org/top-10-film-review-websites/>

But they're not truly interactive,and the end user is reduced to the 
role of an observer.

So Kenstream is a web app which will have an android and iOs app soon to
solve this silly problem by making entertainment reviews more immersive.
